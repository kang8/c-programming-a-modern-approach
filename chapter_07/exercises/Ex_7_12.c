/**
 * Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and
 * d is a variable of type double. Explain what conversions take place during
 * the execution of the following statement:
 *
 * d = i + f;
 *
 * ---
 *
 * 1. execute `i + f`, i will be converted to float, assume result is `res`.
 * 2. execute `d = res`, res will be converted to double, then store to d.
