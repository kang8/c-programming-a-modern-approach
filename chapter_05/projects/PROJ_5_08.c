/**
 * The following table shows the daily fights from one city to another:
 *
 * Departure time     Arrival time
 *  8:00 a.m.          10:16 a.m.
 *  9:43 a.m.          11:52 a.m.
 * 11:19 a.m.           1:31 p.m.
 * 12:47 p.m.           3:00 p.m.
 *  2:00 p.m.           4:08 p.m.
 *  3:45 p.m.           5:55 p.m.
 *  7:00 p.m.           9:20 p.m.
 *  9:45 p.m.          11:58 p.m.
 *
 * Write a program that asks user to enter a time(expressed in hours and
 * minutes, using 24-hour clock). The program then displays the departure and
 * arrival times for the flight whose departure time is closest to that entered
 * by the user:
 *
 * Enter a 24-hour time: 13:15
 * Closest departure time is 12:47 p.m., arriving at 3:00 p.m.
 *
 * Hint: Covert the input into a time expressed in minutes since midnight, and
 * compare it to the departure times, also expressed in minutes since midnight.
 * For example, 13:15 is 13 âœ• 60 + 15 = 795 minutes since midnight, which is
 * closer to 12:47 p.m.(767 minutes since midnight) that to any of the other
 * departure times.
