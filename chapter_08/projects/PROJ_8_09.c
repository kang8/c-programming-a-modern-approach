/**
 * Write a program that generates a "random walk" across a 10Ã—10 array. The
 * array will contain characters (all '.' initially). The program must randomly
 * "walk" from element to element, always going up, down, left, or right by one
 * element. The elements visited by the program will be labeled with the letters
 * A through Z, in the order visited. Here's an example of the desired output:
 *
 * A . . . . . . . . .
 * B C D . . . . . . .
 * . F E . . . . . . .
 * H G . . . . . . . .
 * I . . . . . . . . .
 * J . . . . . . . Z .
 * K . . R S T U V Y .
 * L M P Q . . . W X .
 * . N O . . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . . . .
 *
 * Hint: Use the srand and rand function (see ../deal.c) to generate random
 * numbers. After generating a number, look at its remainder when divided by 4.
 * There are four possible values for the remainder--0, 1, 2, and 3--indicating
 * the direction of the next move. Before performing a move, check that (a) it
 * won't go outside the array, and (b) it doesn't take us to an element that
 * already has a letter assigned. If either condition is violated, try moving in
 * another direction. If all four directions are blocked, the program must
 * terminate. Here's an example of premature termination:
 *
 * A B G H I . . . . .
 * . C F . J K . . . .
 * . D E . M L . . . .
 * . . . . N O . . . .
 * . . W X Y P Q . . .
 * . . V U T S R . . .
 * . . . . . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . . . .
 * . . . . . . . . . .
 *
 * Y is blocked on all four sides, so there's no place to put Z.
 *

 * 0 is go right, +1, 0
 * 1 is go down , 0, +1
 * 2 is go left , -1, 0
 * 3 is go up   , 0, -1
