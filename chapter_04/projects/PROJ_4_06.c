/**
 * European countries use a 13-digit code, known as European Article Number(EAN)
 * instead of the 12-digit Universal Product Code(UPC) found in North America.
 * Each EAN end with a check digit, just as a UPC does. The technique for
 * calculating the check digit is also similar:
 *
 * Add the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth digits.
 * Add the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh digits.
 * Multiply the first sum by 3 and add it to the second sum.
 * Subtract 1 from the total.
 * Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
 * Subtract the remainder from 9.
 *
 * For Example, consider Güllüoglu Turkish Delight Pistachio & Coconut, which
 * has an EAN of 8691484260008. The first sum is 6 + 1 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 17, and
 * the second sum is 8 + 9 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 0 = 31. multiplying the first sum by 3
 * and adding the second yields 82. Subtracting 1 gives 81. The remainder upon
 * dividing by 10 is 1. When the remainder is subtracted form 9, the result is
 * 8, which matches the last digit of the original code. Your job is to modify
 * the ../upc.c program of Section 4.1 so that it calculates the check digit for
 * an EAN. The user will enter the first 12 digits of the EAN as a single
 * number:
 *
 * Enter the first 12 digits of an EAN: 869148426000
 * Check digit: 8
